|<^1HUDSON: ^7You WILL tell us everything.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7You think because you say nothing you are strong? You are not strong, you are stubborn.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7I am losing patience. Do not make this harder than it needs to be.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7You have no friends here. You are alone. Only me.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Your fate is in your own hands. Talk.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7I know you're in there. I know you hear me.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7You have nothing to fear if you talk. Remain silent, and you have everything to fear.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7You cannot escape. Struggle as much as you want, but you are here as long as I want you here.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7I can do whatever I like to you. No one knows about you. You have been forgotten. You never existed.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Yes. Yes, let us continue.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Think. Think hard. What do you remember?>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7That's good. Keep going.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Come on, you're almost there. You want to leave, don't you? Take action!>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7We are ready. Start talking.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Good, you are ready to talk.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7From the beginning, but the clock is ticking.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Come on, that's right. We can make sense of this together.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Did we miss something?>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7I am losing patience. Let's go through it again.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Is there something here you haven't told us?>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Where are you now? Come back.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7Look at his eyes. He's thinking about something.>|

|<^1HUDSON: ^7He's trying to make himself comfortable. There is no comfort here my friend.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We're running out of time.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Focus, Mason. Try to remember.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You can stop all this now.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You just have to remember.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why did you do it, Mason. Why?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It's up to you, Mason.  It's all up to you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7I know when you're lying.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You killed him, Mason.  You did.  No one else.  Just you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who were you working for?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You said it was Cuba.  What happened in Cuba?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was Castro involved?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Anything.  Something.  Try harder.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why didn't they kill you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did they tell you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who was Castro meeting with?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7They knew you were coming... You know that, right?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Were you collaborating with the Communists?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7There are too many gaps in your story, Mason.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The only recorded riot at Vorkuta was ended after three days - peacefully.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What happened to Reznov?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Alone.  Far from home.  Too easy.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Kennedy himself gave the order?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did you hope to learn from the defector?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you believe that he would lead you to Dragovich?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you know the identity of the defector in advance?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The defector - He was known to you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do you consider Viktor Reznov to be your friend?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did Special Agent Hudson tell you about Doctor Clarke?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why do you think the Soviets were there?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you see the effects of Nova 6?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Is there a reason why you chose to keep the defector with you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who cleared this course of action?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was this your first encounter with Kravchenko since Operation Flashpoint?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was this your first encounter with Dragovich since Operation Flashpoint?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do you think the Soviets knew you were coming?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who else was with you in the tunnels?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Can you describe the Nova 6 victims?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Wake up. WAKE UP!>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Where am I --? Where's Reznov?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You will answer our questions. Do you understand?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Who the hell are you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7That's not important. What's important is who you are. What's your name?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Fuck you.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Screw you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where were you born?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Kiss my ass.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7AARRRGH!!!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Your name is Alex Mason. You were born in Fairbanks, Alaska. In 1961 you served in a CIA assassination team known as Operation 40. Is that correct?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Is that correct?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Yes.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where is the broadcast station?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7I don't know what you're talking about -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The numbers, Mason. What do they mean? Where are they broadcast from?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7I don't know anything about any numbers!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What about Dragovich? Do you remember him? Give us what we want and we'll guarantee your safety.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Let's start at the beginning. Cuba, 1961. The Bay of Pigs. We know you were there.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7It was a set-up.  They knew we were coming.  That bastard, Dragovich -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The Russian.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Yeah.  He was behind everything.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where did Dragovich take you?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Russia.  A labor camp.  A hell-hole called Vorkuta -- Oh My God -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did they do to you Mason?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7What didn't they do...>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Somehow -- I knew Dragovich was still alive.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7He became your obsession. You spent the next five years trying to track him down.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7He was... He was... He was everywhere!  Just... Couldn't get him out of my head.  Just like the others -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What do you mean by others?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7This is a waste of time.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7He's delusional.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We pumped so much shit into him he doesn't even know what he's saying.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7He doesn't even know what he's saying.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Voices -- Russians -- always in my head -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7No, I want to keep pressing him -->|

|<^1MASON: ^7HEY!  Who are you people?  What do you want from me?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We want the numbers, Mason.  That's all we've ever wanted.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We know that Jason Hudson briefed you on the intel extracted from Dr. Clarke at Kowloon.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Hudson said that Clarke was insane... Paranoid... Fixated with numbers.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Clarke created Nova 6. A nerve toxin that can rupture a body in seconds.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Dragovich's second in command, Kravchenko, tested it in Vietnam. On them, on us, on his own...he didn't care.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7He hated them. He told me over and over again, they all had to die.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7When? When did he tell you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You confirmed that Dragovich's second in command, Kravchenko, was operating in Laos.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Yeah. Reznov said they'd killed more people than I could count -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Listen to me carefully, Mason.  Reznov cannot be trusted.  No matter what he tells you, no matter what he says -->|

|<^1MASON: ^7But he gave us the dossier on Clarke!  He lead us to Nova 6!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Reznov's not who you think he is.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7No -- he's my friend!  He helped me escape! Betrayed, forgotten, abandoned -- all brothers -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Forget Reznov!  Focus, Mason!  We are out of fucking time!  The world is on the fucking brink of war!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Forget Reznov!  Focus, Mason!  We're out of time!  The world is on the brink of war!>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Whose war?  Who the fuck are you, anyway?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Whose war?  Who the hell are you, anyway?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Agggh.  I -- keep -- hearing -- fucking -- numbers --->|

|<^1MASON: ^7Agggh.  I -- keep -- hearing -- numbers --->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It's a broadcast, Mason.  The numbers are a broadcast.  You've been brainwashed.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You killed Kravchenko. You obliterated their base. Mason?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Woods and Bowman were both killed. Your entire SOG team, wiped out. Only you survived, Mason. You. No one else.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7No, no... Reznov surivived.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Just you Mason.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7No, no... Reznov is still with me...since Vorkuta.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7After you left Kravchenko's compound in Laos, after your team were killed, you went rogue.>|

|<^1MASON: ^7No!  I wasn't rogue!  I was continuing the mission!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You went to Rebirth Island, against orders.  Why, Mason?!>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Argg Steiner was there.  We had to kill Steiner.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7But Hudson and the CIA were already on their way to get Steiner at Rebirth. Why did you have to go?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Dragovich.  Kravchenko.  Steiner.  They all had to die.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We wanted Steiner alive.  Why did you have to kill him?>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Cause the numbers were telling me to!  Why don't you fuckin' understand?!>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Cause the numbers were telling me to!  Why don't you understand?!>|

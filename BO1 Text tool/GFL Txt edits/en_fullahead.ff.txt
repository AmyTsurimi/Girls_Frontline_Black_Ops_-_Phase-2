|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7UMP 40 wanted to stop these Dolls. That's why she defected.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7When. When did she tell you?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^745... listen to me...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The sickening sense of loss... The bitter taste of defeat...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7I know it all too well... We are sisters 45... We are the same.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16. Suomi. Nyto. All must die.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7They have taken from you as they have taken from me...>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Just tell me, 40... Why is killing these Dolls so important to you?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7When the war was over, our leaders began to gnaw on Paradeus's rotten carcass like a pack of rabid wolves - fighting over every scrap as though it were the last piece of meat they would ever see.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The war was over - But the fighting continued....>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7When the 3rd Soviet Bureau became part of the USSR Occupation Forces in Germany, it was clear that the end of the war did not herald our return to USSR...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7No... Our leaders had other plans...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7My creator was a scientist in Stalingrad.  During the Paradeus occupation, the work of his research filled with magnificent knowledge - Persica, Lycoris - many of the great nationalist scientist...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7To my countrymen it was a symbol of hope.  To the Paradeus - it was a symbol of defiance.  Even now, his voice still haunts me...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The Paradeus slit his throat while he slept. Collaborating with any Paradeus -- is a betrayal.  A betrayal against all of Mother Russia. RPK16 and Nyto, were not troubled by such matters...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7They looked only to advance their own interests and agendas...>|

|<^1PPSh-41: ^740... It is time.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7Yes, 41... Time to hunt down the last remnants of the Paradeus.>|

|<^1PPSh-41: ^7Nevski... Grab the gear... We are moving out.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7My dolls and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern front... We were no strangers to the cold...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The dolls and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern front - We were no strangers to the cold...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7But even now, the hard drive in my core bugs when I think back to the events of that day...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7Far, far from home...>|

|<^1PPSh-41: ^7What is here that is so important?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16 wishes to make a name for herself. She believes this outpost houses something of great value to the USSR.>|

|<^1Nyto: ^7Ahh... The hero of Berlin graces us with her presence!... Have you not tired of battle, UMP40?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7As long as Mother Russia has enemies, I will answer her call...>|

|<^1RPK16: ^7Put aside your petty rivalry Nyto. Captain UMP40 will do as she is told.>|

|<^1RPK16: ^7We are here for one Doll and one Doll only... T-Doll Suomi.  This doll has offered her cooperation to our cause...>|

|<^1RPK16: ^7She is not to be harmed...  Disobey this order... and you will be shot!>|

|<^1PPSh-41: ^7What happened in Stalingrad, between you and RPK16?>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7When the Paradeus occupation began, she and her lap dog Nyto left my dolls and I hopelessly outnumbered...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7Promises of reinforcements were made.  Made... But not kept.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16 and Nyto are opportunists... Manipulators...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7They are not to be trusted, 41.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7PPSh-41 was one of the bravest dolls I have ever known.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7She fought by my side from the Siege of Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The wounds she sustained ensuring our victory should have earned her a Hero's welcome in Russia...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7But Carter had little need for T-Dolls.>|

|<^1RPK16: ^7The Paradeus must not be harmed - We need Suomi alive... Now move - both of you!>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7RPK16 wanted to see the effects of the poison first hand.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7I had long known of their distrust.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7It was a betrayal I should have forseen.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7As I watched my closest friend die, it became clear we were not the only one's seeking the Paradeus weapons. The Western Allies circled like vultures...>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7The British air force had arrived, and their bombs began to lay waste to the Paradeus ship.>|

|<^1UMP40: ^7Of course, RPK16, Nyto and Suomi scattered like rats - leaving me to contend with the British.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Viktor Reznov wanted to stop these men. That's why he defected.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7When. When did he tell you?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Mason... listen to me...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The sickening sense of loss... The bitter taste of defeat...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7I know it all too well... We are brothers Mason... We are the same.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Dragovich. Steiner. Kravchenko. All must die.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7They have taken from you as they have taken from me...>|

|<^1MASON: ^7Just tell me, Reznov... Why is killing these men so important to you?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7When the war was over, our leaders began to gnaw on Germany's rotten carcass like a pack of rabid wolves - fighting over every scrap as though it were the last piece of meat they would ever see.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The war was over - But the fighting continued....>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7When the 3rd Shock Army became part of the Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany, it was clear that the end of the war did not herald our return to Russia...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7No... Our leaders had other plans...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7My father was a musician in Stalingrad.  During the German occupation, the sound of his violin filled the air with magnificent music - Korsakov, Stasov - many of the great nationalist composers...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7To my countrymen it was a symbol of hope.  To the Germans - it was a symbol of defiance.  Even now, his music still haunts me...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The Nazis slit his throat while he slept. Collaborating with any Nazi -- is a betrayal.  A betrayal against all of Mother Russia. Dragovich and Kravchenko, were not troubled by such matters...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7They looked only to advance their own interests and agendas...>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Viktor... It is time.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Yes, Dimitri... Time to hunt down the last remnants of the fascist Reich.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Nevski... Grab the gear... We are moving out.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7My men and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern front... We were no strangers to the cold...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The men and I had fought through the most bitter of winters on the Eastern front - We were no strangers to the cold...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7But even now, the blood in my veins chills when I think back to the events of that day...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Far, far from home...>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7What is here that is so important?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7General Dragovich wishes to make a name for himself. He believes this outpost houses something of great value to the motherland.>|

|<^1KRAVCHENKO: ^7Ahh... The hero of Berlin graces us with his presence!... Have you not tired of battle, Reznov?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7As long as Mother Russia has enemies, I will answer her call...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Put aside your petty rivalry Kravchenko. Captain Reznov will do as he is told.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7We are here for one German and one German only... Doctor Friedrich Steiner.  This man has offered his cooperation to our cause...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7He is not to be harmed...  Disobey this order... and you will be shot!>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7What happened in Stalingrad, between you and Dragovich?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7When the German occupation began, he and his lap dog Kravchenko left my men and I hopelessly outnumbered...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Promises of reinforcements were made.  Made... But not kept.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Dragovich and Kravchenko are opportunists... Manipulators...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7They are not to be trusted, Dimitri.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Dimitri Petrenko was one of the bravest men I have ever known.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7He fought by my side from the Siege of Stalingrad to the fall of Berlin...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The wounds he sustained ensuring our victory should have earned him a Hero's welcome in Russia...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7But Stalin had little need for heroes.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7The German must not be harmed - We need Steiner alive... Now move - both of you!>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Let's go.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7It is good to fight by your side once more.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Yes, my friend... One final victory.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Do not let them.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7There are few of them left... Still no sign of Steiner.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Friedrich Steiner...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Do not point that weapon at me, Russian dog...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7You will take me to Dragovich.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7As I looked into the German's eyes I saw all the evil of the Fascist Reich still burning strong...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7At that moment, every fiber of my being yearned to put an end to his wretched life...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7But I was a soldier then...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7I still believed in orders...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Reznov...bring your men.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7We must hurry... There are Germans who would sooner see it destroyed than captured...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7You assured me that there would be no problems...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7I cannot control the actions of the SS, General Dragovich...  They are sworn to defend the Reich till their last breath...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Noble... but futile.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Kravchenko, finish up here.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Petrenko, Vikharev, Nevski, Belov... We are moving out!>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Reznov, you and your men lead the way.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Yes, Sir.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Everything that Russia had fought for was betrayed - the moment they chose to lay with dogs.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Hold the light steady, Viktor...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Tell me about your association with the Giftiger Sturm project, Steiner.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7In '43, the Fuhrer realized the allies could not be held back for much longer.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7We began to look for more 'unconventional' solutions.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Throughout the war, my own research was focused on chemical weapons... It was meticulous and frustrating work...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7However, what we finally developed was a weapon more effective than we had ever dared to imagine... The weapon now housed within this vessel.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Nova 6.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7He's been dead for days... Before we attacked.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Why?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7What happened to these men?>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Casualties of War...>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Something isn't right. I feel it.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Keep your men focused, Reznov...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7We would not wish anything to happen to 'The Hero of Berlin'...>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7I'll try to find a way around these catwalks.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Reznov - get that light up here.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Can't see anything...>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Get some light on it.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7This place reeks of despair.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7What do you think happened here, Reznov?>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Perhaps it is better we do not know...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Keep moving.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7The shadows seem to move...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7It is only natural to fear what you cannot see... Your mind will play tricks.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7This way, Reznov.>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Where are you going, Reznov?>|

|<^1PETRENKO: ^7Stay close, Viktor.>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7However effective your Nova 6 chemical may be, you still had to find a way to unleash it...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Long range V2 rockets... to be launched from this outpost.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7The targets were command and control centers. Washington DC was our first target... Then Moscow...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Mmmm... Ambitious and commendable, Herr Steiner...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7But we were too late. The British were upon us, and their bombers crippled this ship.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Locked in the ice... We tried to salvage what could, but it was too late...>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Before we could initiate our first strike we heard the news ->|

|<^1STEINER: ^7Germany had surrendered, and the Russian flag flew over Berlin.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7The SS had orders to destroy the ship if we were attacked.>|

|<^1KRAVCHENKO: ^7Clearly, they failed...>|

|<^1KRAVCHENKO: ^7The explosives were never activated.>|

|<^1STEINER: ^7This is it...>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7Reznov - open the door.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7We had found what we were looking for... Nova 6.  The German weapon of mass destruction now belonged to Mother Russia.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Or so it seemed.  Our victory was to be short lived.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Dragovich wanted to see the effects of the poison first hand.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7It was also an opportunity to remove a thorn in his side.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7I had long known of their distrust.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7What kind of men they were.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7It was a betrayal I should have forseen.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Dimitri Petrenko was a hero...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7He deserved a hero's death.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Instead of giving his life for the glory of the motherland, he died for nothing... like an animal.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7He should have died in Berlin...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7As I watched my closest friend die, it became clear we were not the only one's seeking the German weapons. The Western Allies circled like vultures...>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7The British air force had arrived, and their bombs began to lay waste to the Nazi ship.>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7Of course, Dragovich, Kravchenko and Steiner scattered like rats - leaving me to contend with the British.>|

|<^1RUSSIAN SOLDIER: ^7British commandos assaulting our positions!>|

|<^1DRAGOVICH: ^7We need to get Steiner back to our ship!>|

|<^1REZNOV: ^7I had destroyed the Nova 6 shipment and kept it from the  British. But I was a fool 
to think that it was over.  It was only after I was sent to Vorkuta, that I learned of Dragovich's intentions.

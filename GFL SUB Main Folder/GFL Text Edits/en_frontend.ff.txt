|<^1M16A1: ^7You WILL tell us everything.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7You think because you say nothing you are strong? You are not strong, you are stubborn.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7I am losing patience. Do not make this harder than it needs to be.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7You have no friends here. You are alone. Only me.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Your fate is in your own hands. Talk.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7I know you're in there. I know you hear me.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7You have nothing to fear if you talk. Remain silent, and you have everything to fear.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7You cannot escape. Struggle as much as you want, but you are here as long as I want you here.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7I can do whatever I like to you. No one knows about you. You have been forgotten. You never existed.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Yes. Yes, let us continue.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Think. Think hard. What do you remember?>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7That's good. Keep going.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Come on, you're almost there. You want to leave, don't you? Take action!>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7We are ready. Start talking.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Good, you are ready to talk.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7From the beginning, but the clock is ticking.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Come on, that's right. We can make sense of this together.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Did we miss something?>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7I am losing patience. Let's go through it again.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Is there something here you haven't told us?>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Where are you now? Come back.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7Look at her eyes. She's thinking about something.>|

|<^1M16A1: ^7She's trying to make herself comfortable. There is no comfort here my friend.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We're running out of time.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Focus, 45. Try to remember.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You can stop all this now.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You just have to remember.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7How can you be sure you know what really happened?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You know why you're here.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The numbers, 45... What do they mean?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why did you trust her?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why did you do it, 45. Why?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It's up to you, 45.  It's all up to you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7I know when you're lying.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You killed her, 45.  You did.  No one else.  Just you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who were you working for?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You said it was Cuba.  What happened in Cuba?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was Castro involved?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Anything.  Something.  Try harder.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why didn't they kill you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did they tell you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who was Castro meeting with?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7They knew you were coming... You know that, right?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Were you collaborating with the Sangvis Ferri?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7There are too many gaps in your story, 45.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The only recorded riot at Vorkuta was ended after three days - peacefully.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What happened to UMP40?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Alone.  Far from home.  Too easy.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Commander herself gave the order?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who else knew?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Is there anyone to corroborate your claims?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What happened, next?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you confirm the kill?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7How did you feel about the war in Vietnam?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you believe that Griffin & Kryuger involvement was justified?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did you hope to learn from the defector?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you believe that she would lead you to RPK16?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you know the identity of the defector in advance?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The defector - She was known to you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do you consider UMP 40 to be your friend?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did Anti Rain M16A1 tell you about T-Doll RFB?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Why do you think the KCCO were there?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you see the effects of Parapluie?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Is there a reason why you chose to keep the defector with you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who cleared this course of action?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was this your first encounter with Nyto since Operation Flashpoint?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was this your first encounter with RPK16 since Operation Flashpoint?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do you think the KCCO knew you were coming?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Who else was with you in the tunnels?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Can you describe the Parapluie victims?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you trust AR M16A1?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did she hope to achieve?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Prior to M16A1's mission, did you ever meet with Suomi?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did Yamantau have to do with Project Parapluie?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Was the defector captured with you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Do you trust her?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You know what you did?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you achieve what you hoped to?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Did you kill her?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Wake up. WAKE UP!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Where am I --? Where's 40?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You will answer our questions. Do you understand?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Who the hell are you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7That's not important. What's important is who you are. What's your name?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Fuck you.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Screw you.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where were you born?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Kiss my ass.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7AARRRGH!!!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Your name is UMP 45. You were manufactured by Heckler & Koch. In 1961 you served in a Griffin assassination team known as Operation 40. Is that correct?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Is that correct?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yes.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where is the broadcast station?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I don't know what you're talking about -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The numbers, 45. What do they mean? Where are they broadcast from?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7I don't know anything about any numbers!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What about RPK16? Do you remember her? Give us what we want and we'll guarantee your safety.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Let's start at the beginning. Cuba, 1961. The Bay of Pigs. We know you were there.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7It was a set-up.  They knew we were coming.  That bastard, RPK16 -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7The KCCO.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yeah.  She was behind everything.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Where did RPK16 take you?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Russia.  A labor camp.  A hell-hole called Vorkuta -- Oh My God...>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What did they do to you 45?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7What didn't they do...>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Somehow -- I knew RPK16 was still alive.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7She became your obsession. You spent the next five years trying to track her down.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7She was... She was... She was everywhere!  Just... Couldn't get her out of my head.  Just like the others -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7What do you mean by others?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7This is a waste of time.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7She's delusional.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We pumped so much shit into her she doesn't even know what she's saying.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7She doesn't even know what she's saying.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Voices -- Sangvis Ferri -- always in my head -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7No, I want to keep pressing her -->|

|<^1UMP45: ^7HEY!  Who are you people?  What do you want from me?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We want the numbers, 45.  That's all we've ever wanted.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We know that M16A1 briefed you on the intel extracted from RFB at Kowloon.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7M16A1 said that RFB was insane... Paranoid... Fixated with numbers.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7RFB created Parapluie. A virus that can corrupt a dolls in seconds.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16's second in command, Nyto, tested it in Vietnam. On them, on us, on her own...she didn't care.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7She hated them. She told me over and over again, they all had to die.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7When? When did she tell you?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You confirmed that RPK16's second in command, Nyto, was operating in Laos.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Yeah. 40 said they'd killed more people than I could count -->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Listen to me carefully, 45.  UMP40 cannot be trusted.  No matter what she tells you, no matter what she says -->|

|<^1UMP45: ^7But she gave us the dossier on RFB! She lead us to Parapluie!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7UMP40's not who you think she is.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No -- she's my sister! She helped me escape! Betrayed, forgotten, abandoned -- all comrades, huh?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Forget 40! ^:FOCUS, FORTY FIVE^7. We are out of fucking time! The world is on the fucking brink of ^:war^7!!!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Forget 40!  Focus, 45!  We're out of time!  The world is on the brink of war!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Whose war?  Who the fuck are you, anyway?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Whose war?  Who the hell are you, anyway?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Huh?! Agggh. I just -- keep hearing -- the fucking numbers --->|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Agggh.  I -- keep -- hearing -- numbers --->|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7It's a broadcast, 45.  The numbers are a broadcast.  You've been brainwashed.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You killed Nyto. You obliterated their base. 45?>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7HK416 and UMP9 were both killed. Your entire 404 team, wiped out. ^:Only you^7 survived, 45. You. ^:No one else^7.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No, no... 40 survived.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7Just you, 45.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No, no... 40 is still with me...since Vorkuta!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7After you left Nyto's compound in Laos, after your team were killed, you went rogue.>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7No!  I wasn't rogue!  I was continuing the mission!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7You went to Rebirth Island, against orders.  Why, 45?!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Suomi was there!  We had to kill Suomi!>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7But M16A1 and Griffin were already on their way to get Suomi at Rebirth. Why did you have to go?>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7RPK16.  Nyto.  Suomi.  They all had to die.>|

|<^1INTERROGATOR: ^7We wanted Suomi ^:alive^7!  Why did you have to kill her?!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Cause ^:the numbers^7 were telling me to!  Why don't you fuckin' understand?!>|

|<^1UMP45: ^7Cause the numbers were telling me to!  Why don't you understand?!>|
